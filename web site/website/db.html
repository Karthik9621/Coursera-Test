 the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.

 his fight with Goku on Namek, including multiple invasions of Earth. Recently, he has been chosen 
 to represent Universe 7 as the tenth member of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of Power as a

 prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short
 stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu
 Saga onwards) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments
