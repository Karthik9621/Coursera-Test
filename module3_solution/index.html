                        <p>
                            Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision. The game follows a shinobi known as Wolf as he attempts to take revenge on a samurai clan who attacked him and kidnapped his lord. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2019, and will be released for Stadia in October 2020.

                            Sekiro is set in a re-imagined Japan during the late 16th century Sengoku period, where warlord Isshin Ashina has staged a coup and seized control of the land of Ashina.[1] During this time, a nameless orphan is adopted by the wandering shinobi named Ukonzaemon Usui, known to many as "Owl," who named the boy "Wolf" and trained him in the ways of the shinobi. Two decades later, the Ashina are on the brink of collapse due to the now elderly Isshin falling ill and the clan's enemies steadily closing in. Desperate to save his clan, Isshin's adoptive grandson Genichiro sought the Divine Heir Kuro so he could use the boy's "Dragon Heritage" to create an immortal army. Wolf, now a full fledged shinobi and Kuro's personal bodyguard, loses his left arm while failing to stop Genichiro.

                        <p>
                            The Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins, whos memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern day period through the use of a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as "desynchronization" of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.

                            Having escaped Abstergo with the aid of Assassin mole Lucy Stillman, Desmond explores the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in Florence. Ezio trains as an Assassin to avenge his father and brothers, who were killed by order of a corrupt Templar official. He is aided by allies such as Leonardo da Vinci and Caterina Sforza, and combats enemies such as Rodrigo Borgia. When Ezio uses Borgia's Pieces of Eden, he discovers a hologram of a figure calling herself Minerva, who warns Desmond, through Ezio, of a disaster that destroyed her society and may soon destroy humanity.

                            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

                            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

                            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

                            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
